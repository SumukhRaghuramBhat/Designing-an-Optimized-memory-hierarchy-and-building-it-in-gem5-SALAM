# Designing-an-Optimized-memory-hierarchy-and-building-it-in-gem5-SALAM
A set of applications are initially chosen and their memory access is examined at LLVM abstraction using the Locality Aware Memory Assignment and Tiling (LAMAT). It is an open source tool for automated application-specific on-chip memory assignment and tiling which uses the gem5-Aladdin tool for performance &amp; power evaluation. But instead of using gem5-Aladdin, this project would build it on gem5-SALAM. Using LAMAT with gem5-SALAM optimizes the memory hierarchy by automatically combining the benefits of cache and scratchpad at variable level granularity per individual application.
